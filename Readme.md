# Instrument Price Tracker

## Overview

**Instrument Price Tracker** is a robust and scalable system designed for managing and tracking the latest prices of various financial instruments. The system supports batch processing of price records, retrieval of the latest price information, and efficient management of price records based on instrument types and durations.

## Features

- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes batches of price records, updating the latest prices for each instrument.
- **Price Retrieval**: Retrieve the latest price record for an instrument by its ID or name.
- **Instrument Type Support**: Handle price records for different instrument types with the ability to filter by type.
- **Historical Price Lookup**: Fetch price records within a specified duration.
- **Price Clearing**: Clear price records either for specific instruments or all records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven for dependency management
- SLF4J for logging

### Run the Application

You can run the application using your IDE or via the command line.

## Enhancing System Scalability, Reliability, and Throughput

### Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
    - **Microservices**: Break down your application into smaller, independent services that can be scaled independently.
    - **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of your services.

2. **Distributed Systems**
    - **Data Partitioning**: Divide your data into partitions or shards to distribute the load across multiple databases or storage systems.
    - **Caching**: Use caching solutions like Redis or Memcached to reduce the load on your databases and improve response times.

3. **Message Queues**
    - **Asynchronous Processing**: Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to decouple services and handle high volumes of requests more efficiently.

### Reliability

1. **Fault Tolerance**
    - **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers to handle failures gracefully and prevent cascading failures.

2. **Monitoring and Alerting**
    - **Health Checks**: Implement health checks and monitoring to detect and respond to failures quickly.
    - **Alerts**: Set up alerting systems to notify of issues or anomalies in real-time.

3. **Backup and Recovery**
    - **Regular Backups**: Schedule regular backups of your data and configurations to prevent data loss.
    - **Disaster Recovery**: Implement disaster recovery plans to quickly restore services in case of catastrophic failures.

4. **High Availability**
    - **Failover Mechanisms**: Set up failover mechanisms to ensure that services remain available even if a component fails.

### Throughput

1. **Optimized Data Access**
    - **Database Indexing**: Optimize database performance by indexing frequently queried columns.
    - **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas to offload read operations from the primary database and improve throughput.

2. **Load Distribution**
    - **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Use CDNs to cache and deliver static content closer to users, improving response times and throughput.

### CI/CD

1. **Continuous Integration**
    - **Automated Builds**: Set up automated build processes to ensure that code changes are continuously integrated and tested.
    - **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests to verify that new code does not break existing functionality.

2. **Continuous Deployment**
    - **Automated Deployments**: Use deployment pipelines to automate the deployment process, ensuring consistent and reliable releases.
    - **Rollbacks**: Implement rollback mechanisms to revert to previous versions in case of deployment failures.
